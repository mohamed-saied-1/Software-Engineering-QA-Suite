## 🏗️ Software Engineering Artifacts

### 1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
A professional document following the **IEEE standard** that outlines:
* **Functional Requirements:** User authentication, car management, and booking workflows.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** Security protocols, system scalability, and performance benchmarks.
* **Business Rules:** Admin approval processes and refund policies.

### 2. System Modeling & Design (UML)
Detailed diagrams created to visualize the system architecture:
* **Use Case Diagrams:** Defining user interactions (Admin, Owner, Customer).
* **Activity & Sequence Diagrams:** Mapping the logic of car booking and user verification.
* **Class Diagrams:** Outlining the object-oriented structure of the backend.

### 3. Project Management (Jira Framework)
* **Agile Methodology:** Implementation of Task tracking and Sprint management.
* **Workflow Visualization:** Diagrams illustrating the lifecycle of a feature from "To-Do" to "Done".
